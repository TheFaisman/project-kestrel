/*
    A permutation is an ordered subset of a set. For example, say you wanted to pick a combination
    to a vault. There are 60 possible numbers, and you need three different numbers for the combination.
    There are P(60,3) permutations for the combinations, where P is defined by 
    
        P(a,b) = a! / (a-b)!

    Combinations are similar to permutations, except that the order doesn't matter. The formula is

        C(a,b) = P(a,b) / b!

    Design a program that asks users for two numbers, and asks them whether they want to calculate
    permutations or combinations, and prints the result.
